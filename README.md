# Homework 12 - Employee Tracker

## Description

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a CLI that would manage the status of various employees in a MySQL db. It uses inquirer to navigate selections and edit employees.I was able to get my queries operating as I wanted, but some reason, trying to console log my tables has caused me some issues. After much research, I'm not sure why my code cancels out my program once I attempt to log a table but will keep collaborate with others to find a solution.
